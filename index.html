            <div class="description"> The idea of coworking with robots has become a controversial topic in the future work environment. In our proposal, we use the future restaurant as a platform to talk about the emotional relationship and coworking experience between robots, chefs, waiters, and clients. In a highly automated artificial intelligence restaurant, how will coworking change the working environment in the future? We listed different speculative scenarios: Barista’s robotic arm, Robots restaurant hiring human labor, Automotive water filling, and chief with robots in the kitchen. We use video editing and collaging as a tool to present the scene not only to show the future working possibilities but also leave possible problems when humans work with robots for the audience to imagine. This project encourages the audience to rethink future coworking possibilities and issues when robots become an essential part of our work environment.

             <div class="description">  DO YOU REALLY REMEMBER IT? lies in exploring how to achieve a superpower that alters the memories of others. Memories seem to be private and difficult to change easily through outside intervention, and in this superpower is going to be realized without actively interfering with the participant, in the premise that the participant subjectively perceives the environment, but still can change the participant's memory.
                This project tries to achieve the superpower by building an interactive experimental virtual space that works with people through Google Cardboard. In this experiment, visual media such as images and videos are of great significance for memory change, while the perception of the environment is also the starting point for how a person constructs a memory palace. The project examines how people remember certain spaces by interviewing random peers, trying to identify important pieces of their memory palaces and how they can modify them to change their memories. The virtual space will build their memory palace based on the interview transcripts and reconstruct the space by replacing some of the important pieces, environment and senses as the experiencer walks into the space, gradually feeling their memories being constantly influenced as they interact with the virtual space.

With two apis, <a href="https://www.themealdb.com/api.php">TheMealDB</a> and<a href="https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub">EmojiHub</a> , we created a fictional Emoji character on a web page who loves meat and hates vegetables. The user can "prepare a meal" to them, and the little Emoji will react accordingly to the type of meal and their own preferences.
